# Events

The WebPlayer component provides various events that you can listen to or handle via callback props. These events allow you to respond to different states and actions within the WebPlayer.

## Event Handling Options

There are two main ways to handle WebPlayer events:

1. Using callback props on the WebPlayer component when using frameworks
2. Adding event listeners directly (vanilla JavaScript)

The table below lists all available events, their types, and descriptions. An example of how to use these events is provided below each table.

<WebPlayerEventsTable />

:::info

- The default prefix for all WebPlayer events is `"cc-webplayer:"`. This prefix helps to avoid potential conflicts with other events in your application. You can access it through the constant `DEFAULT_EVENT_PREFIX`
- You can customize the event prefix by setting the `eventPrefix` property on the WebPlayer component.
